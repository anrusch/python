This outline will help solidify concepts from the Mathematical Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x= "name" + "yours"
print (x)
#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x= 3 + 3
print (x)


#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable
x=4-2
print (x)


#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x= 3.6- 2.5
print(x)
#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y=9*3
print (y)



#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

x="Mom" * 3
print (x)
#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x=4/2
print (x)



#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y= 6.5/2.5
print (y)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x-6 % 4
print (x)


#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x= 20//4
print (x)


#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x= 2 ** 2
print (x)


#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

y 3+3
print (y)
