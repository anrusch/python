This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.
'''

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

apple= 3
pear= 2
f=  (apple == pear)
print  (f)
#false

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x= (3==3)
print (x)
#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x= (7>4)
print (x)
#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y= (100<3)
print (y)
#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
g= (20>=30)
print (g)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
h= (5000<= 400)
print (h)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
3>=8
print (x)
